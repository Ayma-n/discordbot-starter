# Discord Bot Starter Kit
Welcome to Hack@Brown's Discord Bot starter kit! In this kit, we're providing you with some boilerplate code, as well as a little guide to get started on building your very own bot!

Not only is building a bot a fun and exciting project, but it also teaches valuable skills in programming and automation. Moreover, considering how widely used Discord is, you'll be able to have significant impact and improve Discord users' experience! Additionally, as Discord supports numerous media types (audio, video, text, images, etc.), possibilities are basically infinite!

The first few steps of building a Discord bot are very generic and can sometimes be annoying. But, fear not: we've completed them for you! The boilerplate we're providing has the code for a working Discord bot that is able to respond to a very simple ping slash command.

## 1. Boilerplate Structure
This boilerplate uses Node.js and the discord.js module, and is written in TypeScript. You can find the folder structure of our starter kit below:

.
├── src/
│   ├── commands/
│   │   └── ping.ts
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── IntentOptions.ts
│   ├── handlers/
│   │   └── onInteraction.ts
│   ├── interfaces/
│   │   └── ICommand.ts
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── deployCommands.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.json

We have included comments in each file we wrote, that explain the purpose of the most fundamental parts of the code. Make sure to read them to better understand how the boilerplate works.
